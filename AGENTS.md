# 🤖 AGENTS.md — Janstech Apps repository rules for Codex / AI agents

This repository is the public Janstech Apps static website.

Production domain:

- https://janstechapps.com/

The repository hosts:

- Janstech Apps landing page
- shared public assets
- app-specific legal/support pages
- GitHub Pages custom domain configuration

---

# 🔴 CRITICAL RULE

No change is complete unless:

- the site still works
- public URLs are not broken
- documentation is updated when structure or behavior changes
- changes are committed

---

# 🌐 PRODUCTION URL POLICY

The production domain is:

- https://janstechapps.com/

Agents MUST NOT replace production links with:

- janstech.github.io
- localhost
- temporary preview URLs
- old standalone privacy-policy repository URLs

All public links should use the janstechapps.com domain unless there is a clear external target such as Google Play.

# 🔗 PUBLIC URLS THAT MUST KEEP WORKING

Agents MUST preserve or intentionally update these public URLs.

## Landing page

- https://janstechapps.com/

## Shopping List & Notes / Kauppalista

- https://janstechapps.com/apps/kauppalista/
- https://janstechapps.com/legal/kauppalista/
- https://janstechapps.com/legal/kauppalista/support.html
- https://janstechapps.com/legal/kauppalista/terms.html
- https://janstechapps.com/legal/kauppalista/delete-data.html

## WaveIQ Radio

## GainsAI

- https://janstechapps.com/legal/gainsai/
- https://janstechapps.com/legal/gainsai/support.html
- https://janstechapps.com/legal/gainsai/terms.html
- https://janstechapps.com/legal/gainsai/delete-data.html

Before completing work, agents MUST check that internal links still point to valid paths.

---

# 🧾 LEGAL CONTENT RULE

Legal content must be preserved carefully.

Agents MUST NOT casually rewrite:

- privacy policy text
- terms text
- support instructions
- delete-data instructions
- data handling descriptions

Legal text may only be changed when explicitly requested or when fixing:

- broken links
- outdated URLs
- formatting
- navigation
- contact details

If legal content changes, the final response must clearly mention what was changed.

---

# 🖼️ ASSET POLICY

Shared static files belong in:

- assets/

Use root-relative paths where appropriate:

~~~text
/assets/AI.png
/assets/GainsAI.png
/assets/iq_kuv1.png
/assets/favicon.ico
~~~

Do NOT leave random images or favicons in the repository root.

When moving assets, update all references in:

- index.html
- legal pages
- Open Graph metadata
- favicon links
- README.md if relevant

---

# 🧭 LINKING RULE

Use stable root-relative links for internal site navigation:

~~~text
/legal/waveiq/
/legal/waveiq/support.html
/assets/AI.png
~~~

Do NOT use fragile paths unless there is a specific reason:

~~~text
../
../../
~~~

Before completing work, search for old/broken patterns:

- janstech.github.io
- *-privacy-policy-main
- ../
- localhost
- 127.0.0.1

Exceptions are allowed only if deliberately documented.

---

# 🏷️ APP BRANDING RULE

This repository is for Janstech Apps, not the personal portfolio.

Agents MUST NOT add personal portfolio content unless explicitly requested.

Avoid:

- personal CV content
- portfolio project pages
- generic GitHub profile promotion
- unrelated developer biography

Keep the site focused on:

- Janstech Apps
- Android apps
- Google Play links
- privacy/support/terms/delete-data pages
- brand contact information

---

# 🔐 SECURITY AND PRIVACY RULE

Never commit:

- API keys
- Firebase service account files
- Google credentials
- OpenAI keys
- .env secrets
- private tokens
- local config containing credentials

If such files are found, do not move or expose them. Report them immediately.

---

# 🌍 LANGUAGE RULE

The public landing page may contain both English and Finnish UI text.

When editing bilingual content:

- keep English and Finnish versions consistent
- do not remove either language accidentally
- update translation dictionaries when visible text changes
- avoid mixed-language UI unless it already exists intentionally

Legal pages may be app-specific and language-specific. Preserve their existing language and structure unless explicitly requested.

---

# 🧪 VALIDATION RULE

Before completing changes, agents SHOULD run a local static server when practical:

~~~bash
python -m http.server 8000
~~~

Then test key pages locally:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/apps/kauppalista/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/apps/waveiq/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/legal/kauppalista/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/legal/waveiq/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/legal/gainsai/

At minimum, validate:

- landing page loads
- CSS loads
- app logos load
- favicons do not use broken paths
- privacy/support/terms/delete-data links work
- no 404s for expected public pages

---

# 🔎 REQUIRED SEARCHES BEFORE COMPLETION

Before finalizing a task that changes paths, links or structure, search for:

- janstech.github.io
- privacy-policy-main
- waveiq-radio-privacy-policy
- kauppalista-privacy-policy
- gains-ai-privacy-policy
- localhost
- 127.0.0.1

Also search for broken relative path patterns when relevant:

~~~text
../
../../
~~~

If any remain, explain whether they are intentional.

---

# 📘 DOCUMENTATION RULE

Update README.md whenever changes affect:

- folder structure
- production URLs
- deployment assumptions
- GitHub Pages configuration
- legal page paths
- asset paths
- testing instructions

README should remain concise and useful.

---

# 🌍 PUBLIC PAGE LOCALIZATION RULE

All public user-facing pages in this repository MUST support both:

- English (EN)
- Finnish (FI)

This applies to:

- the main landing page
- app landing pages under `/apps/`
- legal/support pages when they already use the bilingual page template
- shared navigation
- CTA buttons
- footer links
- metadata where practical

When adding or editing public pages, agents MUST:

- preserve the existing EN/FI language toggle pattern
- provide all visible user-facing text in both languages
- avoid mixed-language UI
- keep terminology consistent across pages
- ensure language switching updates all relevant text on the page

For app landing pages, language switching MUST cover at minimum:

- hero title and subtitle
- feature cards
- benefit sections
- privacy/local-first/AI summaries
- Google Play CTA text
- support/legal link labels
- footer/contact text

Agents MUST NOT create English-only public landing pages unless explicitly requested.

A public page task is not complete until bilingual behavior has been considered and implemented.

---


# 🚀 GITHUB PAGES RULE

This repository is served by GitHub Pages from the repository root.

The custom domain is controlled by:

~~~text
CNAME
~~~

Expected CNAME content:

~~~text
janstechapps.com
~~~

Do NOT delete or rename CNAME.

Do NOT replace it with the old GitHub Pages domain.

---

# ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE

A task is complete only when:

- implementation works
- relevant links are updated
- no expected public page returns 404 locally
- root folder remains clean
- legal content is preserved unless explicitly changed
- README is updated if structure or URLs changed
- changes are committed

---

# 🧾 FINAL RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS

After completing work, report:

- commit hash
- changed files
- final folder/tree summary if structure changed
- public URLs to test
- any assumptions
- any remaining issues

If no commit was made, clearly say why.

---

# 🏁 FINAL RULE

This repository represents the public Janstech Apps brand.

Keep it:

- clean
- stable
- professional
- easy to maintain
- safe for Google Play public links
